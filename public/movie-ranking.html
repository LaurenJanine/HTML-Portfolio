<h1>The Best Movies According to Lauren</h1>
<h2>My top 3</h2>
<hr />

    <h3>About Time</h3>
    I haven't seen a movie that has made me feel as good as About Time in a long time.  I love the focus on treating everyday like it is your last.  Very family focused and reminds me to be a light to others.
    <h3>Julie and Julia </h3>
    Food.  Sometimes I think I can smell this movie while watching.
    <h3>How to Train your Dragon</h3>
    I'm sure there are many more movies I could list but I am in my "mom of toddlers" phase, and this is one movie I don't mind being played 10x a day.
